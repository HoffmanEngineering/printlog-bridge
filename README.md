# printlog-bridge

An open-source bridge agent that watches Klipper/Moonraker printers and logs every print to [3D Print Log](https://www.3dprintlog.com) automatically: real outcome, duration, per-spool filament usage and a picture, with no manual entry and no printer config edits.

It runs in **local mode** on the printer's own host (Moonraker Unix socket) or in **remote mode** on any LAN host (Pi, Docker, NAS) over Moonraker's WebSocket, which covers locked-down printers such as the Snapmaker U1 and Creality K2.

> Status: in planning. See the [issues](https://github.com/HoffmanEngineering/printlog-bridge/issues) and milestones for the roadmap.
